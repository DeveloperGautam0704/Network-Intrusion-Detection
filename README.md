# Network-Intrusion-Detection
 "Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) for monitoring and analyzing network traffic in real-time, using signature-based and anomaly detection techniques to identify potential threats. Features include real-time alerts and traffic visualization with support for machine learning-based anomaly detection."

 
The notebook file appears to be focused on performing machine learning tasks, particularly with an emphasis on network intrusion detection. The code involves:

Data analysis and preprocessing using Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Machine learning models like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression for classification.

There are references to loading and analyzing a dataset, likely containing network traffic data, as part of the training and testing process.
